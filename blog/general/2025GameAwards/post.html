                <p>The Game Awards are almost here! Geoff Keighley's 3 hour advertisement fest is happening next week (at the time of writing) and I couldn't be more excited. It's effectively become the E3 replacement for the modern day, with big announcements from most major developers and publishers flowing freely during the show.</p>
                <p>And while the announcements are the main draw for me at least, the awards are also an interesting view into how the industry is generally feeling and what direction it's moving in. I am acutely aware that the awards themselves should not be taken as any kind of real mark of quality, but I am also aware of the fact that with this being the biggest gaming awards show around today, winning this award is a big popularity boost for the studios and individuals who end up getting it. That ends up circling back around onto these studios and individuals continuing to do the work they won the award for. So I don't take the awards themselves as significant critically, they are significant for the production of things I like being made more.</p>
                <p>All that effectively justifies why I place any kind of importance on the actual awards themselves. If something I really like wins, that generally encourages that studio and the industry as a whole to prioritize games and other creative works in that similar vein. It's also fun to try and guess what's gonna win in general.</p>
                <p>With all of that out of the way, let's get to the predictions and votes themselves! I will be having two nominees for each category, one that I predict is going to win, and the one that I believe will actually win. We'll start from last category to first category on The Game Awards website, need to leave the best for last after all.</p>
