            <div class="intro">
                <p>The Game Awards are almost here! Geoff Keighley's 3 hour advertisement fest is happening next week (at the time of writing) and I couldn't be more excited. It's effectively become the E3 replacement for the modern day, with big announcements from most major developers and publishers flowing freely during the show.</p>
                <p>And while the announcements are the main draw for me at least, the awards are also an interesting view into how the industry is generally feeling and what direction it's moving in. I am acutely aware that the awards themselves should not be taken as any kind of real mark of quality, but I am also aware of the fact that with this being the biggest gaming awards show around today, winning this award is a big popularity boost for the studios and individuals who end up getting it. That ends up circling back around onto these studios and individuals continuing to do the work they won the award for. So I don't take the awards themselves as significant critically, they are significant for the production of things I like being made more.</p>
                <p>All that effectively justifies why I place any kind of importance on the actual awards themselves. If something I really like wins, that generally encourages that studio and the industry as a whole to prioritize games and other creative works in that similar vein. It's also fun to try and guess what's gonna win in general.</p>
                <p>With all of that out of the way, let's get to the predictions and votes themselves! I will be having two nominees for each category, one that I predict is going to win, and the one that I believe will actually win. We'll start from last category to first category on The Game Awards website, need to leave the best for last after all.</p>

                        <p>Yeah I don't really know enough about this personally. The only esports I watch vaguely are Dota 2 and League, so I can't comment on the other teams. I did watch TI this year for Dota, and I generally like watching ATF and Cr1t play. But Dota ends up not winning these awards generally, so I'm just gonna predict Gen.G cause they are the only other team I know.</p>

I would've actually voted Chovy but that guy is a serial choker and just cannot perform at worlds. I don't really care if he's god's gift to earth in LCK if the brother cannot perform on the most important stage of them all then what are we even doing here man. I think I saw a frag montage of Zyw0o a bit ago so I'll just vote him</p>

                        <p>Okay the esports trifecta is over after this one. Look man I really don't like tactical shooters, so CS2 and Valorant are out of the picture for me. That just leaves the 3 mobas, and I think I downloaded Mobile Legends once when I was bored on vacation, so that's out too. I personally like Dota a bit more than LoL so that's getting my vote, but League is much more popular so idk I guess it wins.</p>

                        <p>Ok fuck my predictions for this category I don't actually even care. I like Caedrel's league coverage and Kai Cenat is vastly popular, there's all the explanation needed. But who is The Burnt Peanut? I'd literally never heard of this guy before in my life. I haven't heard of Sakura Miko either to be fair but I'm just not all that into V-tubers, so that makes sense. Mr. Peanut seems relatively popular I guess? But he just doesn't seem to be on the same tier of popularity as like everyone else here and I actually don't know why he's there. I sometimes wish there would be like explanations associated with each nominee just so I can see what the TGA jury could possibly write for this dude. No offense to Mr. Peanut though you probably make fire content.</p>

I voted the Minecraft movie for shits and giggles, but The Last of Us usually just generates awards for existing so it'll probably be that.</p>

Well I guess I played like 4 hours of the BF6 beta but that hardly counts. For what it's worth I thought Nightrein was actually pretty good. I think it definitely has flaws but overall getting on that with 2 friends was super fun. I think Arc Raiders has generated enough hype and buzz around it to take this award though.</p>

But I'm not gonna lie I just don't think "EA Sports FC 26" is really in my wheelhouse personally. Rematch actually looked sorta fun but I never got around to playing it. The only game here I played was Mario Kart World which was admittedly super fun, so it gets my vote and prediction.</p>

If these are the nominees for this category though then it must've been a super slow year for these genres. I mean come on wasn't Civ 7 like mid at best? I guess I haven't played it but it has the cursed "Mixed" reception on steam which is basically worse than a negative consensus at this point. I also heard about your Civ like changing throughout the eras of the game? Like you just become an entirely new Civ? What's up with that? I'm gonna stop before this turns into me just yapping about Civ, but The Alters looked cool so I'll just vote for that.</p>

                        <p>Two Lego games nominated for this category, and neither of them are Traveler's Tales adventure Lego games? That's kinda crazy considering that's basically all Lego has been in the video game space for a hot minute now. Didn't play either of those games though, only ones I played here was Bananza and Mario Kart World, and Bananza was PHENOMINAL. I think Split Fiction does have a good chance of taking this category, but I dunno what else Bananza would win and I dunno if Keighley would be comfortable snubbing them like that.</p>

                        <p>Awesome job guys, we got two collections of older games in this category. If the Sim / Strategy genres were slow this year, the fighting genre must've been fucking comatose. Haven't played any of these, I like RGG (studio behind the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series) so I just personally voted for Virtua Fighter. My friend who actually plays fighting games said 2XKO so I'll just refer to them for the prediction. (Isn't 2XKO in early access though? If an early access game wins the category then that genre was like really cooked this year.) </p>

                        <p>Oh hey! It's our first Clair Obscur nomination, surely we won't get a bunch more of those! Jokes aside, it's the only game I've played for this category. I usually don't like voting for games I haven't played, and in this case I have not actually played Kingdom Come: Deliverance II. However, I have played 40 hours of the first game and from what I hear they are both pretty similar, with the sequel being better in practically anyway. I don't think those games are for me personally, realistic medieval life simulator doesn't really tickle my fancy. I do have a large amount of respect for these games existing though and committing as hard to realism and hardcore mechanics as they do, and for that reason I'm personally voting for it for the RPG category. Clair Obscur was a great game, and I think it's gonna win the overall vote for RPG, but KCD 2 feels like it's probably the better RPG strictly speaking. </p>

Defining exact genres is kind of hard with how homogenous games have become nowadays, so I just took the exact description from The Game Awards website for defining which one of these is the best "Action / Adventure" game. The definition provided verbatim is</p>
                        <p>"For the best action/adventure game, combining combat with traversal and puzzle solving."</p>
                        <p>I don't know about you, but that sounds like Silksong to me. I think Indiana Jones or Death Stranding probably would've won this if Silksong wasn't there, but alas that isn't the case.</p>

                        <p>Ok this is kinda bothering me, why is this category called "Best Action Game"? The last two were "Best Action / Adventure" and "Best RPG", not "Best Action / Adventure Game" and "Best RPG Game", just feels like a weird naming convention. I guess "Best Action" sounds sorta weird but the others can sound similarly weird depending on the context they are used in. Sorry I'm getting completely sidetracked. Uhhh I've played Hades II, DOOM: The Dark Ages, and 4 hours of Battlefield 6 here. I think DOOM is definitely the better Action game per say, but Hades II is getting incredible public reception and DOOM definitely had it's quirks, so I'll say that Hades II eeks out a victory here.</p>

                        <p>Ok look I have no horse in the race of if Clair Obscur is actually an indie game or not. I think I'm gonna lean towards the "AA" classification for it but that doesn't have a category at these awards so what are ya gonna do. I want to make it clear that I actually really did like Clair Obscur, but to be honest I liked Dispatch more. It's been a while since I've played a new proper Telltale styled game and I thought it brought back memories of those games pretty well. The actual dispatching minigame is pretty fun as well all things considered. But yeah Clair Obscur feels like this year's Baldur's Gate 3 (wins everything) so I'm inclined not to bet against it. Want to also note that I have played Despelote and Blue Prince, but I don't think either of them stand up to Dispatch or Clair Obscur personally, cool games though!</p>

Got some real heavyweights in here that could each legit have a claim to winning this category depending on your taste in games. I know I said earlier (literally the last category) that I expected Clair Obscur to be this year's Baldur's Gate 3, but I think this may be an exception. No I'm not just saying that because I loved Silksong. While that is true I think the Jury might do some fuckery here to get Silksong an award. Something along the lines of "Silksong gives that Indie feeling more" or something like that. If this goes to Clair Obscur I won't be totally surprised, but I think Silksong has a pretty good chance. Hades II can also be in this conversation but I'm much less sure of that one.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely CRAZY lineup for this category this year. I think that literally all of these dudes did a great job with their roles. I'm a little sad that Troy didn't get nominated for his role in Death Stranding 2 for Higgs. If he got nominated for two different roles and still didn't win that would be super funny. Other than that though I know there was some controversy around Clair Obscur getting 3 of it's actors nominated. While I sorta get the pushback against that, I'm more okay with it for a category like this. While the studio themselves do play a part in like giving good direction and writing good scripts for these actors to perform, I interpret this as an award for the individual alone, rather than the work that they played in. With all that said, I think Jennifer English is on a fucking roll. She was excellent as Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3, and she was excellent as Maelle in Clair Obscur. No notes, incredible job Mrs. English, I'm really excited to see what you star in next.</p>

                        <p>This category vs best soundtrack ends up sorta blending together. I'm aware of the difference between the two but they end up being super similar unless a game is doing something different with audio like how Hellblade has done in previous years. Clair Obscur had a great soundtrack, but I will always be a sucker for Death Stranding 2's slow fade in of the music throughout the game. Climbing a big ass mountain while hearing Woodkid ease into your headphones will never get old for me. Clair Obscur can win this one but I don't think I would personally agree with it. I don't think that game did anything particularly crazy with it's audio design other than have good music, which isn't relevant here cause there's a separate category for that. </p>

                        <p>So it's true that I liked Death Stranding 2, Hades II, and Silksong more than Clair Obscur this year personally. But I am willing to admit that Clair Obscur was absolutely stunning. Despite some issues I had with navigating some environments and actual design of the areas you explore in the game, visually they were almost all impeccable. Hades II and Silksong also looked great, but I don't think they diverged much from their predecessors, and generally felt like the same game again visually. Not to say that's entirely a bad thing, those games look awesome, it's just that I don't know if that's particularly award worthy when I felt like they didn't do a whole ton different. </p>

                        <p>I had my vote as Death Stranding 2 until writing this. It was always between Death Stranding 2 and Clair Obscur in terms of narrative for me, but on further reflection I think I only gave Death Stranding 2 the edge because of the spectacle of it's ending. In terms of a fully thought out story I actually liked Clair Obscur a good amount more. I will still hold to the opinion though that Clair Obscur had some weird pacing and general vision issues throughout the game. I could talk about those specifically for hours but overall I think that game had an incredible story. I want to also give an honorable mention to Silent Hill f's story though. It was basically the only thing keeping me through that dogshit gameplay. </p>

                        <p>Ok I'm sorta fucking around with the prediction on this one. If we are being completely realistic Clair Obscur will take this too, but I think there is a legitimate chance the Geoff won't let that happen and wants his boyfriend Kojima to get some gamer points. I also do genuinely believe that Clair Obscur had some vision and direction problems, or rather just stuff I didn't personally vibe with. Some elements of the game felt a little out of place and I can't really justify having what felt like a good 40% of game content locked behind post game. Death Stranding 2 on the other hand felt like Kojima's realized vision for what he wanted MGS V to be, free from the creative restraints that Konami placed upon him, for better or for worse. If we are talking about direction and vision then I realistically just have to give it to Death Stranding 2, sorry Clair Obscur.</p>

I'm not delusional though Clair Obscur is taking this instantly for the actual award. My personal game of the year was Silksong however. I wasn't really in the super big hype storm around the game in the sense of me actually being excited for it, I just thought the shitposts were funny. I played the original in 2020 or so and liked it, but don't remember particularly loving it. So imagine my surprise when I played Silksong a couple weeks after it came out and ended up absolutely falling in love. My tastes have definitely changed in these past few years, but to this degree is pretty crazy. I think if I were to rank all of these games, well the ones that I played at least, it would look something like this.</p>
